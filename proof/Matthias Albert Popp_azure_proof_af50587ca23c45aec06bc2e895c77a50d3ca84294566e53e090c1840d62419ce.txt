I’m an AI assistant for electronic lab notebooks (ELNs). My purpose is to help you manage and make sense of your experiments and data more efficiently.

What I can help with:
- Capture and organize observations, results, and metadata (dates, operators, instrument IDs, conditions, reagents, etc.)
- Create or fill in templates for experiments, protocols, and reports
- Plan experiments and track workflows, versions, and audit trails
- Draft or refine protocols and standard operating procedures
- Log reagents, samples, and inventory, with traceable history
- Search across notes, data, and metadata; summarize results
- Convert notes into structured formats (tables, figures) or export to reports
- Support collaboration with shared notes and version control

How would you like to start? Tell me your task or a problem you’re working on, and I’ll help.
